\chapter{Abstract}
This document contains some basic exercises that evaluate your suitability for working in my research
group at Chalmers. Please provide your solutions in the form of PDF (we highly appreciate LateX skills)
and also working code (wherever asked) in a language of your choice (preferably C++, Matlab, Ruby,
Julia or Python1
).
